## Controlling the interface

### Opening Omni

To open Omni, simply press `‚åò+T` . You can change the shortcut when clicking the extension.

### Closing Omni

To close Omni you can press `Esc`, click on the background, or press the extension icon.

### Switching between dark and light mode

The dark and light theme in Omni is tied to your system's theme.

On Mac you can change the theme by clicking on the Apple menu (on the top left), opening the System preferences, going into the General section, and then choosing between dark, light, or auto.

On Windows it depends on the OS version. [Here is a guide for Windows 11 and 10.](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/change-desktop-background-and-colors-176702ca-8e24-393b-15f2-b15b38f69de6#ID0EBF=Windows_11)

After switching the theme you might need to restart your browser.

## Self-hosting Omni

You can run Omni locally without having to install it from the Chrome Store or from Firefox Add-ons.

### Installing on Chrome

2. Go to chrome://extensions/ in your browser, and [enable developer mode](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv2/faq/#:~:text=You%20can%20start%20by%20turning,a%20packaged%20extension%2C%20and%20more.).
3. Drag the [src folder](https://github.com/alyssaxuu/omni/tree/master/src) (make sure it's a folder and not a ZIP file, so unzip first), or click on the "Load unpacked" button and locate the folder.
4. That's it, you will now be able to use Omni locally.

### Installing on Firefox

1. Download the code. In the web version of GitHub, you can do that by clicking the green "Code" button, and then "Download ZIP".
2. Open the about:debugging page in your browser, click the "This Firefox" option.
3. Click the "Load Temporary Add-on" button, and select any file inside the [firefox folder](https://github.com/alyssaxuu/omni/tree/master/firefox)
4. That's it, you will now be able to use Omni locally.
