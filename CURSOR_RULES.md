# Cursor Rules

## Comment Language

- All comments in all files must use English as the primary language.
- If additional explanations in other languages are needed, they may be added after the English comment, but English must come first.

## UI Language

- All user interface text, including buttons, tooltips, messages, and notifications must be in English.
- This applies to both static text in code and dynamically generated content.

- The close (Ã—) button should only appear when hovering over the bot icon.
- Long press (300ms) is required to initiate dragging of the bot icon.
- Visual indicators should be provided for long-press and dragging states.
